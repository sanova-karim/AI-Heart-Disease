# This tool attempts to help a patient in remote areas of underdeveloped countries
# where patients on chest pain can't decide whether to go to nearest hospital
# which often time is 3-6 hours away. Making arrangement to visit hospital often
# is difficult both economically and time wise. So they tend to make random
# decision. Using this python tool can run on any computer if that remote area
# has a regular desktop computer. The area of Banglades which inspired this code has
# blood testing centers to derermine cholestorol level and some folks have blood pressure machines.
# So the personal data needed for this tool is available, this is just helping a patient to make
# a long and expensive trip to a Hospital in a city more based risk calcualtion as opposed to a random
# one.


1. In order to make it effective heart_disease_data.csv file must be based on
   locality, as universal/western data may not give good prediction due to genetics,
   dietry and life style difference.

2. Running the program:  <py AI-heart-deasese-predict.py>

3. The program assumes that in the same directory exists heart_disease_data.csv file
